Java3D Jogamp Android Readme
===
This code is a collection of altered java classes that override those in the org.jogamp.jogl-all-android project to fix bugs, extend debugging and include the native libraries.

I cannot for the life of me get Android Studio to include the .so files as deployed by Jogamp
